# react-features-examples
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, React has been consistently evolving, introducing new features and improvements. Some of the recent features and updates up to that point include:

1. **React Hooks:** Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Some popular hooks are `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, and `useMemo`.

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

   const ExampleComponent = () => {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     useEffect(() => {
       document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
     }, [count]);

     return (
       <div>
         <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
           Click me
         </button>
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **React Suspense:** Introduced to handle asynchronous operations declaratively. It allows components to "wait" for something before rendering. For example, data fetching with `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`.

   ```javascript
   const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));

   const MyComponent = () => (
     <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
       <SomeComponent />
     </React.Suspense>
   );
   ```

3. **Context API improvements:** React's Context API got improvements to make it easier to use and more efficient. The introduction of `useContext` hook made consuming context values more straightforward.

   ```javascript
   const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);

   const MyComponent = () => {
     const value = useContext(MyContext);
     // Use the value here...
   };
   ```

4. **Concurrent Mode (not fully released in 2022):** Concurrent Mode aims to improve the user experience by allowing React to work on multiple tasks concurrently, making applications more responsive.

5. **Server Components (experimental in 2022):** This feature aimed to improve server-side rendering performance by allowing React components to be rendered on the server separately from the client components.

6. **Portals:** Portals enable rendering children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. It's useful for scenarios like modals, tooltips, etc.

   ```javascript
   const MyPortalComponent = () => (
     <React.Fragment>
       {/* This will be rendered inside #portal-root */}
       {ReactDOM.createPortal(
         <div>Rendered in another DOM node</div>,
         document.getElementById('portal-root')
       )}
     </React.Fragment>
   );
   ```

Please note that React evolves continuously, and new features might have been introduced after my last update. Always refer to the React documentation and release notes for the most up-to-date information on React's latest features and updates.
